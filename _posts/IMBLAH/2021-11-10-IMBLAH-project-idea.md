# Project idea
For the final project, I would like to pursue the Turtle-based option. 
It will be a game app letting beginners play simple piano songs using keyboards because I can see some similarities between computer keyboards and piano keyboards, kind of similar to the piano apps designed for smartphones. There will be 3 levels, increasing in difficulty by changing the songs.

# Work plan
Finish the layout of the game and pick the songs for the game. (Nov 17)
Figure out how to add sounds to keys and start making the game part function. (Nov 24)
Finish the game part and try to finish testing and add a constantly available help dialog. (Dec 1)
Modify the code if needed and focus on the reflection. (Dec 9)
